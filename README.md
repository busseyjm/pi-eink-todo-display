# pi-eink-todo-display
A to-do list displayed on an E-Ink display and hosted on a raspberry pi.

The goal of this project is to create a common to-do list for my household, with a locally hosted website where anyone can add to or remove from the list. This website will have a mobile focus design for usage with mobile devices.
